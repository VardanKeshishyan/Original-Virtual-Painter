# Original-Virtual-Painter
This C++ program, leveraging the OpenCV library, identifies and tracks yellow and pink markers in a live video feed, allowing users to draw with these colors. It applies image processing techniques to detect the markers' contours, draw circles around them in their respective colors, and continuously updates their positions in real-time. This project showcases practical applications of computer vision and image processing, demonstrating the ability to track objects of specific colors and enable interactive drawing using those markers. It highlights skills in image manipulation, contour detection, and real-time video processing, making it a valuable addition to a portfolio focused on computer vision and graphics programming.
